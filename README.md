# EmbedSys-Project
Interactive game that uses JavaFX and runs on Raspberry Pi.

The real-time embedded system being implemented, named Pong Hockey, is a single-player, reaction game that uses the JavaFX framework. The object of the game is to use a player paddle at the bottom of a scene to prevent a bouncing ball from reaching the bottom. The game has three primary scene views: the main menu, the high score list, and the game play scene. Each level is timed, and the player is given three points at the start of each level. Each subsequent level provides increased difficulty in the form of added obstacles, increased ball speed, and multiple balls. For each time that the player fails to prevent the ball from reaching the bottom, a point is deducted. The game ends if the player loses all their points before the timer expires, and the players cumulative time is entered as a high score. The system is designed to be deployed remotely on a Raspberry Pi4 and requires a keyboard and mouse as the primary inputs.
